**Challenge:** Ask a stranger to take my photo, but lay down and plank before they take the picture!


**Reflection:** My very FIRST challenge...

I am the newest edition to the Social Dive team, which meant that I needed to get cracking on these challenges.  The team showed me what they had done in the past and so I took it upon myself to complete a few of the challenges they had already done themselves.  

_Before_: 
Leading up to the challenge, I was extremely excited to participate in these silly tasks.  They sounded like a ton of fun and at first sounded fairly easy.  I've always thought that I'm a decently outgoing person who is comfortable being silly in public.  However, once I started thinking about it in class about half an hour before, I started getting kinda nervous.

_During_:
After class got out it was "Challenge Time".  Oh sh*t...I was so scared all of a sudden.  My heart started pumping; I started making excuses for myself: **"I don't want to bother this person, they look like they are on their way to class"** or **"Uhhh this person doesn't seem very approachable."** 

After walking across campus and back, which took about 30-45 minutes, I finally told myself "JUST DO IT" (not in Shia's voice...), I convinced myself that the next person I saw I would stop them.

I asked a guy who was walking with who I assume to be his girlfriend if he'd take my photo.  I was so nervous I can't remember what I had said, but I said something along the lines of "Can you take my picture? Try to get all this beautiful landscape" or something like that.  When he was ready I asked him to wait for a second and laid down in plank position.  Instantly I heard the girl laugh and say "what is he doing?!?! HAHA".  At that moment I felt a little bit of comfort sink in and I just laughed back and asked the guy to take the photo. 

_After_:
I stood up and took my phone, we both awkwardly chuckled and I gave him a fist bump, thanked him, told him to have a great day, and we parted ways.  After it was all said and done, I came to the realization that it wasn't all that bad, there was no reason for me to be nervous.  It was just a funny thing to do, and quite out of the . Thinking about this experience made me truly feel like I was able to do something that I previously wouldn't have before.  I'm very interested to see what challenges come next and what else can help me _expand my comfort zone._
